# Events Posters

Gets filled with files during `jg sync events`. The `events` job reads data about events, uses the speakers profile pictures in `../avatars-participants/`, and generates the posters. There are multiple posters per event for multiple media, i.e. YouTube, Instagram, etc. Those are hinted by file suffixes.
